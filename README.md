# EtchASketchV2
A program where you can draw whatever you imagination lets you with colors such as black, rainbow, darken, and white. With the help of HTML CSS and JS.

Motivation came from TOP as to learn and get familarize with query selectors and functions. I built this in order to learn! It solves basically world peace or a simple stress reliever if you wanna let your imagination go wild. I learned how call other functions, use event listeners, naming functions and more cleaner code.
